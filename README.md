# ID-Entropy
Code for the paper: "Local Intrinsic Dimensional Entropy"

To run both MNIST_sup and MNIST_unsup, please add a folder called MNIST in the same directory,
and download the pickle file at the link:

MNIST_sup: Outputs ID-Entropy and Test-Accuracy values of feature layer after every 3 training epochs, 
            for a fixed range of training dataset size 
MNIST_unsup: Outputs ID-Entropy and Test MSE-Loss values of the encoded feature layer after 
             every 3 training epochs, for a fixed range of training dataset size
